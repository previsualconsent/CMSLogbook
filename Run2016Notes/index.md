#### Dielectron paper: [AN](http://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/jsp/db_notes/noteInfo.jsp?cmsnoteid=CMS%20AN-2016/190)

There are two "known issues" reported in the paper about electron reconstruction.
 * Endcap shifted position for 3.8T was not used until Run 273726. This affects the measurement of $$\Delta \eta_{in}$$
 * L1 ID for EG H/E was too strict. Fixed from run 275656 and on.
